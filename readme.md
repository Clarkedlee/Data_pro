# Introduction

Explore, segment, and cluster the neighbourhoods in Toronto based on the postal code and borough information. However, unlike New York, the neighbourhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is fascinating about data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so you need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.

For the Toronto neighbourhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighbourhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas data frame so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.

Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighbourhoods in Toronto.
